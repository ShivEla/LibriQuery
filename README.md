# LibriQuery: Command-Line RAG Book Q&A System ðŸ“š

This repository contains two distinct Python implementations of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions about books. Both leverage Open Library APIs for data retrieval and Google Gemini models for natural language understanding and generation. They showcase different architectural approaches to building powerful RAG applications.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Intelligent Q&A:** Ask natural language questions about books (e.g., "What's the plot of 'Dune'?", "Who is Jane Austen?").
* **Comprehensive Data Retrieval:** The system intelligently extracts search terms, then fetches and enriches book data from various Open Library APIs (including detailed descriptions, genres, author bios, publication specifics, and cover URLs).
* **Contextual Generation:** Retrieved information grounds the Gemini LLM, ensuring factual and relevant answers, minimizing "hallucinations."
* **Command-Line Interface:** Simple text-based interaction for quick queries and responses.

## ðŸš€ Implementations

This project offers two distinct RAG system implementations, each with its unique approach:

### 1. LibriQuery: RAG Book Q&A System (LangChain/FAISS/Gemini)

This implementation presents a robust and modular RAG system built using the **LangChain framework**. It demonstrates a more advanced and structured approach to integrating external knowledge into an LLM's responses.

* **RAG Architecture:** Employs a classic RAG pipeline with explicit components for retrieval and generation.
* **Retrieval Mechanism:** Utilizes `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` to convert book content into numerical vectors. These vectors are stored and efficiently searched within an in-memory **FAISS vector database**. When a user asks a question, the system semantically searches this vector store to retrieve the most relevant book passages.
* **LLM Integration:** Integrates the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (using models like `gemini-pro` or `gemini-1.5-flash`) through LangChain's standardized interface.
* **Context and Memory Management:** Leverages LangChain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain` and `ConversationBufferMemory` to automatically manage and inject both the retrieved context and the ongoing chat history into the LLM's prompts. This allows for seamless follow-up questions and a more natural conversational flow.
* **Data Enrichment:** Includes helper functions to fetch detailed book information (descriptions, author bios, publication details, cover URLs) from various Open Library API endpoints, which are then used to populate the FAISS index.

### 2. Unified RAG Book Q&A System with Chat History

This implementation provides a more direct and manual approach to building a RAG system. It focuses on explicit API calls to Gemini and Open Library, alongside custom chat history management.
